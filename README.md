1. Define your API endpoints in `src/App.js`:

```javascript
const metricsApiEndpoint = "/api/metrics"; // Replace with your API endpoint
const predictionsApiEndpoint = "/api/predictions"; // Replace with your API endpoint
axios.defaults.baseURL = "with ur actull api base url";
```

2. Update the API requests in `src/App.js` to match your backend API structure.

### Folder Structure
